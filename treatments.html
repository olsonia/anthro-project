        <h1>Treatments for Postpartum Depression</h1>

        <h2>Screening Tools</h2>
        <p>There are several screening tools available to diagnose postpartum depression. One popular screening test available and widely used in English and Spanish speaking countries is the EPDS. Screening tests are typically inexpensive and easy to administer causing minimal discomfort to patients (Andrina 2021). Screening tests like EPDS are questionnaires with around ten to thirty questions and can typically be completed in anywhere from five to ten minutes. There is also usually a threshold score the patient must get to be considered clinically depressed. Another screening test, the PDSS, is specifically for postpartum depression screening and covers seven domains: “sleeping/eating disturbances, anxiety/insecurity, emotional lability, mental confusion, loss of self, guilt/shame, and suicidal thoughts” (Andrina 2021). In screening tests for postpartum depression, the threshold score that a patient receives can determine the severity of the postpartum depression. However, false positives are common among tests like these. The table pictured is from a literature review conducted by Hana Andrina (2021) and it shows the different screening tools used to diagnose both postpartum depression and depression in pregnancy. This table demonstrates the sensitivity and specificity of each test along with time to complete, number of questions, and if it is available in Spanish.</p>

        <h2>Psychotherapy</h2>
        <p>One possible treatment for PPD is Interpersonal psychotherapy, which is a short-term treatment for major depressive disorder that aims to address various interpersonal issues (Pearlstein 2009). IPT is important to the needs of women during the postpartum period. Pearlstein (2009) suggested that IPT, cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) as well at psychodynamic therapy might be effective treatment in terms of psychological treatments for PPD. Pearlstein (2019) mentions that couples therapy is one that has not had much research about the effect on women with PPD. If there is a mild case of postpartum, counseling from nonmental health professionals might be a better option seeing as IPT and CBT are more helpful for women with severe PPD (Pearlstein 2009). </p>
        <p>Women may not want to use psychotherapy due to their perceived negative stigma regarding it. There also might be a lack of trained therapists available to administer this psychotherapy treatment, which would make it harder for women to access this method of treatment (Pearlstein 2009).</p>

        <h2>Antidepressant Treatment</h2>
        <p>Antidepressant medication is another way to treat postpartum depression. In a study conducted in women with PPD, there was one placebo controlled RCT that compared paroxetine with a placebo and while both groups improved significantly, the paroxetine group was superior in terms of remission of depression (Pearlstein 2009). According to the results of the study Pearlstein (2009) mentioned, remission rates for the paroxetine group was 37% and remission rates for the placebo group was 15%. In another study examined by Pearlstein (2009), paroxetine was compared against combined paroxetine/CBT in women with PPD and comorbid anxiety disorders. Both treatments were found to have significant improvements when measuring depression. Although half of the mothers were breastfeeding, no antidepressant side effects or serum levels in the infants were reported (Pearlstein 2009).</p>

        <h3>Antidepressants and Breastfeeding</h3>
        <p>If a breastfeeding woman with PPD decides to choose antidepressant medication as treatment for her postpartum depression, she must weigh the potential risks of choosing this method. There is the risk of exposing the baby to the medication through breastfeeding as well as the risk of the baby’s development by not treating the mother’s postpartum depression (Pearlstein 2009).</p>
