        <h1>Hypotheses</h1>

        <h2>Life-history Theory: Parental Investment Theory</h2>
        <p>Survival, growth and development, and reproduction were problems that our ancestors would have needed to solve for them to successfully pass on their genetic material. While time, energy, and resources are finite, organisms needed to determine costs and benefits to allocating their investment between somatic and reproductive efforts. According to Tracy (2005) reproductive efforts are broken down further into parenting efforts and mating efforts, where the organism would need to calculate the distribution of energy, time, and resources in a way that is fitness enhancing (Tracy 2005). This means that the parent would have to “size up” their current situation / environment and need to make a fitness-enhancing decision whether to invest in themselves, their offspring, or their mating opportunities (Tracy 2005). As a result of this hypothesis, Tracy (2005) concludes that the investment in offspring is not automatic seeing as there are situations where investing in offspring would cost more than simply investing somewhere else.</p>

        <h2>Social Bargaining Hypothesis</h2>

        <h2>Mismatch Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>The mismatch hypothesis for postpartum depression draws on “evolutionary-mismatch frameworks for understanding diseases of modern civilization” (Hahn-Holbrook 2014). When looking at dietary mismatches that contribute to postpartum depression, hunter-gather diets typically consisted of wild meats, starchy tubers, and seasonal fruits and vegetables. The ancestral diet was richer in micronutrients, fiber, and fatty acids when compared to a modern Western diet (Hahn-Holbrook 2014). It can be concluded that many modern populations are overfed and undernourished because they replace the micronutrient-dense foods with grains (Hahn-Holbrook 2014). Hahn-Holbrook (2014) also discusses that although little research has been done on the topic, a mismatch of breast-feeding rates and time might have an impact on postpartum depression. From the data provided in several studies that Hahn-Holbrook (2014) examined, it could not be concluded that breast-feeding provides mental health benefits. Less mothers are breast-feeding for shorter amounts of time when compared to ancestors and breast-feeding is known to have stress-regulation benefits (Hahn-Holbrook 2014). This breast-feeding mismatch for postpartum depression is hypothesized by Hahn-Holbrook (2014) to partly be a consequence of mothers not using the stress-regulation benefits that breast-feeding provides. Childcare mismatches are shown to exist because hunter-gather families used to live in kin groups where they would be surrounded by large amounts of family to help with the children, whereas modern humans often live far enough from close kin that they are on their own (Hahn-Holbrook 2014). Western families are also more likely to have fewer kids closer in age where it makes it difficult to have an older sibling help with the younger children. Weak social support has consistently been seen as a predictor of postpartum depression, so it would be a reasonable assumption that the shift from “multigenerational families to smaller nuclear families might impact women’s ability to cope with the demands of motherhood” (Hahn-Holbrook 2014).</p>
