        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Postpartum depression is a topic that is under-studied in my opinion. There are still quite a few questions left unanswered and arguably out-of-date articles on the topic with only a few current articles that were able to answer my questions. After studying and reviewing the hypotheses provided, I feel as though the Mismatch Hypothesis would be the most convincing. The Social Bargaining hypothesis, while very intriguing, does not have the data to back it up. Although Tavares (2021) does mention the studies that Hagen and Silva conducted, it does not seem like the benefits of postpartum depression (gaining paternal or social support) would outweigh the costs. The Parental Investment Hypothesis makes a slightly more convincing argument than the Social Bargaining. If the investment in the offspring is not worth it, it would make sense for the body to warn the mother. However, where this does not make sense is because the hypothesis makes it seem like the organism could only chose to invest in one option (themselves, the offspring, or mating), not all three. The Mismatch Hypothesis demonstrates the differences between ancestors and modern humans, provided various ways to look at how the mismatch could have promoted postpartum depression. The only argument I would have against this hypothesis is that it might allude to saying that ancestral humans did not suffer from postpartum depression, or it was not as prevalent, when there is not much research to back that claim up. Other than that, I think it does a good job explaining why postpartum depression might occur in modern humans.</p>
