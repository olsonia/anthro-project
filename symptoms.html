        <h1>Risk Factors and Symptoms of Postpartum Depression</h1>

        <h2>Risk Factors: Biological</h2>

        <h3>Genetic Predisposition</h3>
        <p>There have been several studies that suggest postpartum depression might be partly due to genetic predisposition. Genes that are linked to major depression have been looked at in the context of postpartum depression as well and “findings point to the possible effects of polymorphic variations in genes within the monoaminergic system, but also within the estrogen receptor, the oxytocin peptide, the glucocorticoid receptor and the corticotrophin releasing hormone receptor I genes” (Kettunen 2019). This leads researchers to believe that a genetic predisposition could be a risk factor regarding postpartum depression, but more research would need to be done to confirm these findings.</p>

        <h3>Reproductive Hormones</h3>
        <p>Estradiol, progesterone, and cortisol rise during pregnancy but after delivery, those hormones decrease dramatically while prolactin and oxytocin increase (Kettunen 2019). Even though all women experience fluctuating hormones during pregnancy and after delivery, only few women develop postpartum depression. Hormone withdrawal theories suggest that the withdrawal of estrogen and progesterone in women are proximate causes of depression in vulnerable women (Kettunen 2019). The vulnerability to depression is said to have come from some fluctuations in ovarian hormone levels contributed the interaction between the HPG-axis and HPA-axis according to research done by Kettunen (2019). </p>

        <h3>Stress Hormones</h3>
        <p>Stress hormones are like reproductive hormones in the sense that they both increase over the course of the pregnancy and after delivery both drop. The rise in estradiol levels of serum during pregnancy might stimulate the HPA-axis but after delivery, the estradiol levels of serum decrease along with a decrease in concentration of CRH (Kettunen 2019). Kettunen (2019) found research that has proved that women suffering from postpartum depression has more suppression of the HPS-axis than emotionally stable mothers. Other researchers studied by Kettunen (2019) believe that stress reactivity may be more important than baseline hormone levels regarding the pathophysiology leading to PPD. In addition to stress reactivity, higher CRH levels in mid-to-late pregnancy could be predictive of postpartum depression symptoms during the first couple of months after delivery (Kettunen 2019).</p>

        <h3>Thyroid Hormones</h3>
        <p>Abnormal thyroid function is seen in 3-4% of the general population, while it is seen in up to 7% of women six months following delivery. Kettunen (2019) found research that mentioned pregnancy-related changes in the thyroid having an impact on the serotonin system. There is still debate on if biomarkers suggest links between thyroid antibodies, TSH, T3 or T4 levels with postpartum depression symptoms (Kettunen 2019). However, more research needs to be conducted to have a firm answer.</p>
        
        <h3>Inflammation</h3>
        <p>Stressful life events or even history of depression can leave women more vulnerable to PPD and a result of this vulnerability might end up being a more rapid inflammatory response (Kettunen 2019). There have been inconsistent results in studies conducted but most have provided evidence to suggest an exaggerated proinflammatory response in women with PPD symptoms (Kettunen 2019).</p>

        <h2>Risk Factors: Psychosocial</h2>

        <h3>Relationships in Childhood</h3>
        <p>Kettunen (2019) found that a precursor to PPD is parental caregiving during a mother’s own childhood. They saw that poor parental care and emotional support during childhood has been regularly associated with PPD symptoms, however, recall bias might need to be considered. Adverse family relationship experiences could have influenced the mother in a way that left her more vulnerable to PPD. Many mothers that committed infanticide experienced trauma in their childhood or even adulthood. These mothers also thought of their parents to be demanding and emotionally unsupportive as well (Kettunen 2019).</p>

        <h3>Attatchment and Support from Significant Other and Society</h3>
        <p>Lack of social or partner support is another risk factor for postpartum depression. Social support for women during postpartum aids in reducing the risk for depression and active treatments might not be as necessary if they have the proper social support (Andrina 2021). However, there are limited number of studies on the effects of antidepressant medication and other forms of treatment to be truly confident in that. Early attachment determines adult attachment style, and an insecure attachment style can be indicative of PPD. Insecure attachment, poor support from a significant other, and PPD have been linked together (Kettunen 2019). Kettunen (2019) observed in another study that women with a less secure attachment and a greater dissatisfaction in their partner support were seen to have higher levels of postpartum depression.</p>

        <h3>Past and Present Relationship Violence</h3>
        <p>Significant associations between PPD and abuse were found in studies using developed countries, but domestic violence is still a large risk factor for PPD in developing countries as well. Kuttunen (2019) also noted that substance use and current or past experiences of abuse were linked to an increased risk for PPD. These experiences of violence can predispose the victim to more violence down the line.</p>

        <h3>Socioeconomic Factors</h3>
        <p>Kuttunen (2019) refers to the meta-analyses conducted by O’Hara, Swain, and Beck that low socioeconomic status is unconvincingly related to postpartum depression. More specifically, family income and the occupation of the mother are weak predictors of PPD. However, Kuttunen (2019) noted that other studies have found low education, low income, and unemployment are linked to postpartum depression.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <p>The symptoms of postpartum depression are variable, with changes in hormonal levels following delivery influencing the symptoms that arise (Kettunen 2019). While major depression disorder is useful in diagnosing postpartum depression, PPD is not quite the same as MDD simply due to the prominence of some neurotic symptoms. Neurotic symptoms seen in PPD patients can include things like “anxiety, phobias, irritability, somatic symptoms and fatigue” (Kettunen 2019). Kettunen referenced another article that mentioned insomnia, difficulties staying awake, or difficulties falling asleep as another symptom of PPD. It was more common to see women suffering from PPD have reported experiencing aggressive thoughts rather than women with major depression outside of the postpartum period (Kettunen 2019). There may be benefit towards the care of the infant in some degree of the neurotic symptoms, but if the mother has a maladaptive form of postpartum depression, it could be destructive to mother and infant health.
            Kettunen (2019) mentions that anxiety symptoms are common in postpartum, while psychomotor symptoms like restlessness/agitation and impaired concentration were seen as being prominent in women with major PPD. Women with major depression outside of postpartum reported a sad mood, suicidal ideation, and diminished interest more so than the psychomotor symptoms seen in women with major PPD (Kettunen 2019).
